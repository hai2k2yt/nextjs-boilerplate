# React Flow Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Cannot edit anything when dropping nodes to workspace

### Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Drag and Drop Not Working**
   - **Check**: Open browser console (F12) and look for console logs when dragging
   - **Expected**: You should see "Dragging node type: [type]" when starting drag
   - **Expected**: You should see "Dropped node type: [type]" when dropping

2. **Nodes Not Being Created**
   - **Check**: Look for "Creating new node:" and "Updated nodes:" in console
   - **Solution**: If not appearing, the drop handler might not be triggered

3. **Nodes Not Selectable**
   - **Check**: Click on a node and see if it gets selected (blue border)
   - **Solution**: Ensure `elementsSelectable={true}` is set in ReactFlow component

4. **Properties Panel Not Updating**
   - **Check**: Select a node and see if properties panel shows node details
   - **Solution**: Verify `onSelectionChange` is working properly

### Debugging Steps:

1. **Test Drag and Drop**:
   ```
   1. Open browser console (F12)
   2. Go to /reactflow page
   3. Try dragging a node from sidebar to canvas
   4. Check console for logs
   ```

2. **Test Node Selection**:
   ```
   1. Click on any existing node
   2. Node should get blue border when selected
   3. Properties panel should show node details
   ```

3. **Test Node Editing**:
   ```
   1. Select a node
   2. Go to properties panel on the right
   3. Try changing the label in the "General" tab
   4. Changes should reflect immediately
   ```

4. **Test Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   ```
   1. Select a node
   2. Press Ctrl+D to duplicate
   3. Press Delete to remove
   4. Press Ctrl+Z to undo
   ```

### Common Issues:

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Ensure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Some features may not work in older browsers

2. **React Strict Mode**
   - If using React Strict Mode, some effects might run twice
   - This is normal in development

3. **Console Errors**
   - Check for any JavaScript errors in console
   - Red errors will prevent functionality from working

4. **Network Issues**
   - Ensure all dependencies are loaded properly
   - Check Network tab in dev tools for failed requests

### Expected Behavior:

1. **Drag and Drop**: Should create new nodes when dragging from sidebar
2. **Selection**: Clicking nodes should select them (blue border)
3. **Editing**: Properties panel should allow editing node properties
4. **Movement**: Nodes should be draggable around the canvas
5. **Connections**: Should be able to connect nodes by dragging between handles
6. **Deletion**: Selected nodes should be deletable with Delete key
7. **Undo/Redo**: Should work with Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y

### If Still Not Working:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5
2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure @xyflow/react is properly installed
3. **Restart Dev Server**: Stop and restart `npm run dev`
4. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure all files are readable
